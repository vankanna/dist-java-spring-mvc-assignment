    <h2>Golf Croquet: Easy to Learn, Fun to Play!</h2>

    <p>
        Golf Croquet is a game in itself, completely separate from Association Croquet. Although it has a long history,
        it
        has experienced a recent resurgence of interest at all levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many Golf Croquet tournaments including regular World Championships, so it is not just a beginnerâ€™s
        game.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has a much simpler set of rules and therefore can be learned more quickly than Association Croquet. Games are
        generally more interactive and take less time to complete. This makes it attractive to those who do not have the
        time to play Association Croquet, and beginners can use it to acquire some useful croquet skills.
